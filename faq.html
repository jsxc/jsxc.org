	<a name="xmpp" class="anchor" href="#xmpp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>XMPP
</h3>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, formerly known as Jabber; an Internet standard and open protocol for instant messaging. The XMPP servers by default automatically build a federation, allowing presence information and messages being shared by users according to their privacy preferences, reducing the impact of security breaches.</p>
<p>
	In most organizations, the XMPP username ("JID") corresponds to the (mnemonic) email address, reducing the need to remember additional (non-mnemonic) telephone numbers, even for audio conversations, and thus paving the way toward real Unified Communications. More information can be found in <a href="manual.html#intro">the user manual</a>.
