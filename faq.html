<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>BOSH server not reachable</h3>
<p>There are two main reasons why you can not reach your BOSH server:</p>
<ul>
	<ol>
		<strong>Reason:</strong> Your BOSH server does not work correctly.<br />
		<strong>Test:</strong> Use another XMPP client, like Pidgin to verify that your HTTP binding is working as expected.<br />
		<strong>Solution: Fix your configuration ;-).</strong>
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<strong>Reason:</strongA> You are violating the browser same-origin-policy (SOP), which prevents cross-side requests between sites with different domains or ports (protocols).<br />
		<strong>Test:</strong> Open your JavaScript console and look for errors.<br />
		<strong>Solution 1:</strong> Enable CORS for your BOSH server (Default for ejabberd; prosody needs <code>cross_domain_bosh = true</code>) and if you have a modified content-security-policy (e.g. owncloud), then add your BOSH domain to the <code>default-src</code> section.<br />
		<strong>Solution 2:</strong> Create a proxy like descripted in our [prepare apache guide](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/wiki/Prepare-apache).
	</ol>
</ul>

	<a name="xmpp" class="anchor" href="#xmpp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>XMPP
</h3>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, formerly known as Jabber; an Internet standard and open protocol for instant messaging. The XMPP servers by default automatically build a federation, allowing presence information and messages being shared by users according to their privacy preferences, reducing the impact of security breaches.</p>
<p>
	In most organizations, the XMPP username ("JID") corresponds to the (mnemonic) email address, reducing the need to remember additional (non-mnemonic) telephone numbers, even for audio conversations, and thus paving the way toward real Unified Communications. More information can be found in <a href="manual.html#intro">the user manual</a>.
