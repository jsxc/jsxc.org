We are happy to announce the release of version 2.0.3 of our *XMPP Cloud Authentication* `xcauth`.

## Shared Roster Groups

Quite a few things have been changing related to the roster groups with
*ejabberd*:

* **User names:** When a user's name changes in Nextcloud, her name in the
  roster will also be changed on the next login of herself or one of her
  buddies. If she wants the name in the roster to be different from the one
  in Nextcloud, the roster display name needs to be changed back in a client.
  As both differing names and name changes should be rare, this should not
  cause problems; but keeping both of the in sync avoids confusion.
* **Hidden groups:** If you have large groups (*employees*, *students*, …)
  you may not want to publish them as roster groups due to size, speed, or
  privacy concerns. Now, you can change a group name to end in the special,
  invisible character `U+200B` (Zero Width Space; on Unix entered as
  *Ctrl-Shift-U 2 0 0 B Return*). These groups will not show up in the
  users' roster.
* **Incorrect group memberships:** There was an error in handling the group
  memberships which has been fixed.
* **Disable `store_current_id`:** In earlier versions of the
  [*ejabberd* setup documentation](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/ejabberd),
  we recommended to set `store_current_id: true` for `mod_roster` in
  `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.conf`. This does not work with shared rosters.
  So please change this to `store_current_id: false`.
* **Not executing changes:** The configuration file `/etc/sudoers.d/xcauth`
  was wrong (it required entering a password). So shared roster changes
  were not executed. We are very sorry for that.  
   To reset the group cache, you should issue the following commands as *root*:

```sh
sqlite /var/lib/xcauth/xcauth.sqlite3 'UPDATE rosterinfo SET fullname=NULL, grouplist=NULL, responsehash=NULL;'
```

## Installation

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/releases/latest) or use the `.deb` package repository at `https://dl.jsxc.org/` (`stable` or `nightly`).

When setting up a new server, just follow our
[Debian and/or Raspberry Pi setup documentation](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/raspberry-pi-en),
[also available in German](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/raspberry-pi).

## Full list of changes in v2.0.3

### Added
* Group names ending in U+200B (Zero Width Space) are ignored. This allows
  the Nextcloud admin to blacklist some of the groups (typically large ones).
* Handles underlying file rotation for the log file
  (*not* the error file)
* Logrotate: Restart `xcauth` (the name of the process
  when installed using the `.deb` package)

### Fixed
* Internal state about roster groups was not updated correctly.
  This could have lead to wrong group memberships.
* Symlinks to `ejabberdctl` do not work as expected,
  so changed documentation in `tools/xcejabberdctl.sh`
  for the case that `ejabberdctl` is not installed as
  `/usr/sbin/ejabberdctl`.
* `xcejabberdctl` now no longer requires a sudo password
* Files in Debian packages are now installed with the correct build time
* `make tests` runs the Perl online tests (again)

### Changed
* Renamed `async` to `async_` for Python 3.7 compatibility (#71, #72)
* Now full names for *ejabberd* are set whenever the user's name in Nextcloud
  has changed; as soon as that user or any of his group members logs in again.
  It used to be that it was (essentially) only set once. See [jsxc/jsxc#655](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues/655#issuecomment-427359966).
  We consider this to be the best compromise between automation (the user
  does not need to care) and leaving the user in charge of his/her *ejabberd*
  vCard, as changing the full name in *Nextcloud* should be rare (typically,
  when the user really has a legal name change).
